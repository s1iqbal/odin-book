## Roadmap

- Users must sign in to see anything except the sign in page.
- Users should be able to sign in using their real facebook details. This is fairly easily accomplished using PassportJS, and you should be able to use the knowledge you already have to figure it out from the documentation.
- Users can send friend requests to other users.
-  A user must accept the friend request to become friends.
- Users can create posts. (begin with text only)
- Users can like posts.
- Users can comment on posts.
- Posts should always display with the post content, author, comments and likes.
- Treat the Posts index page like the real Facebook’s “Timeline” feature – show all the recent posts from the current user and users they are friends with.
- Users can create Profile with a photo (you can get this from the real facebook when you sign in using passport)
- The User Show page contains their profile information, profile photo and posts.
- The Users Index page lists all users and buttons for sending friend requests to those who are not already friends or who don’t already have a pending request.
- Deploy v1

- Make posts also allow images (either just via a url, or by uploading one.)
- Allow Users to upload and update their own profile photo.
- Create a guest sign-in functionality that allows visitors to bypass the login screen without creating an account or supplying credentials. 
- Style
